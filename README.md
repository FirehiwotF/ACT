American collage of technology Java Training Notes for Trainees 

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of todayâ€™s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.

Key features, properties and qualities of Java include:

    - Concurrent: Java gives you the ability to run several programs, or part of a program at the same time, improving efficiency
    - Class-based and object-oriented: Allows grouping of objects that can be used across projects, saving you time  
    - Portable: Java runs on a "write once, use anywhere" principle, meaning that once you have written code it can be used on other projects, rather than        starting from scratch
    - Secure: Once created, all Java code is converted to bytecode, which cannot be read by humans, protecting your work from untrusted sources and viruses
    
    
# What is Java used for?

An enormous amount of applications and websites use java and will not work unless you have Java installed. Denying yourself Java is essentially denying yourself access to technological infrastructure. 

From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is a go-to language. Some common uses of Java are listed below:

   - 97% of Enterprise Desktops run Java.
   - 89% of Desktops (or Computers) in the U.S. run Java.
   - 9 Million Java Developers exist worldwide.
   - 3 billion mobile phones run Java.
   - There are currently over 5 billion Java Cards in use.
   - 125 million TV devices run Java.
   - 5 of the Top 5 Original Equipment Manufacturers Ship Java ME
   
# What does Java do? 

Java has become invaluable to developers by enabling them to:

    - Write software on one platform and run it on virtually any other platform.
    - Create programs that can run within a web browser and access available web services.
    - Develop server-side applications for online forums, stores, polls, HTML forms processing, and more.
    - Combine applications or services using the Java language to create highly customized applications or services.
    - Write powerful and efficient applications for mobile phones, remote processors, microcontrollers, wireless modules, sensors, gateways, consumer   products, and practically any other electronic device.
